        [Create a
        meeting](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362413-Scheduling-meetings)
        for a user. This API has a daily rate limit of 100 requests per day.
        Therefore, only 100 **Create a Meeting** API requests are permitted
        within a 24 hour window for a user.


        <aside>The <code>start_url</code> of a meeting is a URL using which a host or an alternative host can start a meeting. The expiration time for the <code>start_url</code> field is two hours for all regular users. 
          
        For custCreate meeting hosts( i.e., users created using the <code>custCreate</code> option via the [Create Users](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api/users/usercreate) API), the expiration time of the <code>start_url</code> field is 90 days from the generation of the <code>start_url</code>.
          
        For security reasons, the recommended way to retrieve the updated value for the <code>start_url</code> field programmatically (after expiry) is by calling the [Retrieve a Meeting API](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api/meetings/meeting) and referring to the value of the <code>start_url</code> field in the response.</aside>
