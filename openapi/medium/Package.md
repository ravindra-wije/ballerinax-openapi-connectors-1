## Configuration

In order to publish on behalf of a Medium account, you will need an access token. An access token grants limited access to a userâ€™s account. We offer two ways to acquire an access token: browser-based OAuth authentication, and self-issued access token.

Please follow this [link](https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs#2-authentication) to obtain the tokens.
